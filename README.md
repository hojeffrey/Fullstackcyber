Robust Recon is a tool created to condense reconnaissance from hours to minutes. It can convert a url to an ip, detect a Web Application Firewall, bruteforce to determine directory paths, make an estimate on which CMS it is running, perform a vulnerability scan, and more. Best of all, it organizes your data in a neat directory.
