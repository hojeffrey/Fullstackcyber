#### Creators: Jeffrey Ho and Sarah Gold (g0ldleaf)

##### Robust Recon is a tool created to condense reconnaissance from hours to minutes. It can convert a url to an ip, detect a Web Application Firewall, bruteforce to determine directory paths, make an estimate on which CMS it is running, perform a vulnerability scan, and more. Best of all, it organizes your data in a neat directory. 


### Requirements: 
##### -kali linux
#####    -wafw00f
#####    -nikto 

### To Run Robust Recon:
##### 1st Argument = url OR ip
##### 2nd Argument = wordlist of your choice


### To Install:
##### ln -s ./path/to/main.py /usr/local/bin/robustrecon

### To View Output:
##### cd into the folder labelled 'Robust Recon: 255.255.255.255'
##### The folder will be labbeled with the IP Address of your target.
